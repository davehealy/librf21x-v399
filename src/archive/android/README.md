# Introduction
This package is the librf21x for android. 

# Building
The android library is base on our Java library. In order to build android library of rf21x, you need CrystaX NDK instead of normal NDK from Google. What's more, you need SWIG.
After change the path of "ndk-build" in "build.sh", you can build this library by build.sh script.
File in "android/jni/extlibs" are libiconv and libusb, you can replace them your your own files. (Source code of these libraries could be found in github)

# Usage
You can use this android version library just like normal java library with java code files generated by SWIG.

# Test
Binary file in 'libs/armeabi/rf21x-wrap-test' can be executed in ADB shell.

# Example and Doc
We have full API documents for C and C++. There is no document for Java yet. Our Java library is based on SWIG, so all the usage are same with  C/C++ API. File 'rf21x_test.java' is an example for JRE.
